# Launches the Cura Streamlit app from the project's own .venv, first killing
# any previously running "streamlit run app.py" instance for this project.


# Why kill old instances first: phase3_pipeline.py loads all models at import
# time, once per process. Closing a terminal/VS Code panel doesn't always
# kill the underlying python.exe child on Windows, so a leftover instance
# keeps holding GPU VRAM -- stack a few of these and the 6GB RTX 4050 runs
# out of memory, which is why the app "breaks after the first image" until
# everything is force-restarted. Always launch through this script instead
# of running streamlit directly.
