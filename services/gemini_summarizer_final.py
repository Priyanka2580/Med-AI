"""
Gemini Summarizer Service (Production)
Calls the Gemini API with a single NER-grounded prompt per doc type.
Production pipeline is classifier -> OCR -> NER -> AbnormalityDetector (reports
only) -> Gemini, so structured entities (and, for reports, abnormality
results) are always available by the time this runs. Abnormality detection
itself happens upstream, in the pipeline -- this module only formats the
results it's given into the report prompt.

  "missing_info_note": "state plainly if any critical info like dosage or duration was missing or unclear, else null"

RULES FOR "medicines" -- THIS IS CRITICAL:
- Include EVERY single medicine mentioned anywhere in the raw text, even if it's not in the structured entities
- For medicines covered by the structured entities: use their exact dosage/frequency/duration values, set "source": "structured_data"
- For medicines found ONLY in raw text (not in structured entities): read the dosage/frequency/duration directly from the raw text yourself, set "source": "raw_text_only". If any of these fields genuinely cannot be found in the raw text either, write "Not specified" for that field
- Do not skip, drop, or summarize away any medicine found in the raw text -- the patient needs to see all of them
- If the same medicine appears in both structured entities and raw text, only include it once, using the structured entities version

RULES FOR "recommended_tests":
- Scan the raw text and entities for ANY mention of a lab test, blood test, scan, X-ray, or follow-up investigation the doctor advised (e.g. "CBC after 2 weeks", "Repeat blood sugar test", "Get an X-ray done")
- If no such advice is found anywhere in the document, return an empty list []
- Do not confuse a test name with a medicine name -- only include genuine diagnostic tests/investigations here

CRITICAL RULES ON REPETITION:
- Do NOT repeat dosage, frequency, timing, or duration instructions in "do_list", "dont_list", or "lifestyle_tips" -- that information belongs ONLY in the "medicines" table
- "do_list", "dont_list", and "lifestyle_tips" must contain NEW information not found anywhere else in the JSON -- think of them as general health/diet/activity guidance related to the condition or medicine class, not medicine-taking instructions
- Example of what NOT to do: "Don't forget to give the second dose" (this is a timing instruction, belongs in medicines table, not here)
- Example of what TO do: "Avoid giving iron supplements with tea or milk, as it reduces absorption" (this is new actionable knowledge)

OTHER RULES:
- Keep "patient_summary" short -- 2-3 sentences only
- "do_list" and "dont_list" should have 2-4 points each, specific to the diagnosed condition and medicine class -- not generic filler
- "lifestyle_tips" should have 1-3 points only
- Do not invent specific dosage/frequency/duration numbers not present in the raw text -- only fill in fields you can actually read in the raw text
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object -- no markdown, no explanation, just valid JSON"""

- If all results are NORMAL, keep do/dont/lifestyle lists short and general wellness-focused, and set "likely_condition" to "No significant issues detected"
